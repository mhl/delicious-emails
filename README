These scripts are useful for creating a regular email summary of links
bookmarked on delicious.com by a group of your friends.

'delicious-recent-summary' produced a plain text summary, either of
the links in the last 7 days or since the last time [TRIGGER-NUMBER]
links were output.  'delicious-email-report' just emails STDIN (if
it's non-empty), so typically you might use this from cron as:

  delicious-recent-summary usernames.txt 20 | delicious-email-report mailinglist@whereever -f 'Links Mailer <me@whereever>' -s 'recent delicious links' -r 'Mailing List <mailinglist@whereever>' -p "[This email contains recent links posted to delicious.com by N&T subscribers.]"
